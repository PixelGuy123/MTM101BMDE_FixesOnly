# MissingTextureMan101's Baldi Modding Dev API

An API primarily for general purpose development for Baldi's Basics Plus mods. It was initially based off two old APIs I used to maintain, but both have been obsoleted and supersceded by this.

You need BepInEx for this API to be useful.

The downloads section on this page is outdated please use the GB page: https://gamebanana.com/mods/383711
